# FlowMap
an automatic algorithm for generation of a one-to-many flow map, start coding~

#The Code is developed to support the findings of our submitted paper entitled â€œA spatial flow map approach using river flow directions assignment algorithm in DEM"

#The tools were implemented in C# on ArcGIS 10.2 software (ESRI, USA), each tool has a separate form to set the input, output and parameters for the algorithms.
