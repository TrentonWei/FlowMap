# FlowMap
An automatic algorithm for generation of a one-to-many flow map, start coding~

#The Code is developed to support the findings of our submitted paper entitled “From river flow to spatial flow： flow map via river flow directions assignment algorithm"，for more details see the pdf file as：http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09395

#The tools were implemented in C# on ArcGIS 10.2 software (ESRI, USA). And the tool has a separate form to set the input, output and parameters for the algorithms.
